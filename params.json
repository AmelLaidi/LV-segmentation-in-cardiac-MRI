  "body": "This code performs semi-automatic segmentation of heart chambers, mainly for LV, in cardiac MR images.\r\nSemi-automatic means that the initial contour should be given to the method by the user.\r\n\r\nThe method employs an active contour approach. A shape can be incorporated into the method to resolve some of the \r\ndrawbacks of active contour methods such as leakage and shrinkage. The default value for the shape weight is zero and can be changed once you add a shape. \r\n\r\nSome sample MR images are provided here. \r\nIf you run the code, an image will be shown to the user and asked for an initial contour.\r\nThe initial contour can be a simple circle or any sort of delineations around or inside the LV chamber.\r\n\r\nAfter initialization by the user, the automatic segmentation will be performed.\r\nThe final figure will show a comparison between the automatic and ground truth segmentations. The ground truth is provided by expert radiologists.  \r\n\r\nReferences \r\n1- Chan, T.F.; Vese, L.A., \"Active contours without edges,\" Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on , vol.10, no.2, pp.266,277, Feb 2001 doi: 10.1109/83.902291\r\n\r\n2- Pluempitiwiriyawej, C.; Moura, J.M.F.; Yi-Jen Lin Wu; Chien Ho, \"STACS: new active contour scheme for cardiac MR image segmentation,\" Medical Imaging, IEEE Transactions on , vol.24, no.5, pp.593,603, May 2005\r\ndoi: 10.1109/TMI.2005.843740\r\n\r\n",
